# i= iterate it will work until it gets false 


for i in range(7):
    print(i)

    # this will print till 6 because i will iterate from 0 till last index that is 6 


    # we can also slice strings or print items in list or tuple usimg rnage function in for loop 

    # the plus point is that we dont even need to givestarting point we can just write length of the list or tuple 

l=[42, "apple", 3.14, True, None, "banana", 7, False, 2.718, "chatgpt"]

for i in l :
    print (i)
else:print("Done")


# else is very less used in practical programming
