# There are four types of operators

a=3

b=4

# 1)Arithmetic Operators

print(a+b)
print(a-b)
print(a*b)
print(a/b)

# 2) Assignment Operator

d=4-2 # 4-2 is  assigned to a

e=6

b+=3 # that means increment 3 to b and store the value in B

print(b) # Same as for increment it will be applicable for decrement


b-=3

print(b)


#3) Comparison Operators

d= 5>=4

print(d)

d= 5<=4

print(d)

# "!" it is used for not equal to & "==" are used to compare two values

#  4) Logical operators 

# normal "AND" "OR" & "NOT" are used to perform logical operations


# NOT just reverses and is used with a single ex :-

print(not(True))
