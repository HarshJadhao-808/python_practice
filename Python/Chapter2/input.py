a=int(input(" Enter a number: "))
b=int(input(" Enter a number: "))

print("Sum of a and b is : ", a+b )

#Default input type is always string
# Here numbers are not added because python considers  input as a string and adds two strings eg :-

c=input( "Enter  a half word a : ")
d=input( "Enter  another half word : ")

print ("The full word is : ", c+d)
